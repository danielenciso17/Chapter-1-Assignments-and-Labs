    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
    <p>HTML documents have tags to organize content. The tags are enclosed in angle brackets, which come in pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag. The content within a webpage is placed between these tags, having its structure and appearance.</p>
    <p>The <br> tag specifies a thematic break in an HTML document.</p>
